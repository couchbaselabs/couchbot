# Ansible Hubot

This is an [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) role for
[Hubot](http://hubot.github.com/), the wonderful chatting robot that is sure
to bring your team much delight and various values of increased productivity
throughout the livelong day!

By default this Hubot is configured for HipChat, but that can be easily
changed by editing `defaults/main.yml`, updating the value of
*hubot_adapter*, and adding the appropriate environment variables to
`templates/hubot.env.j2`.

## Requirements

This Hubot role requires a Debian based Linux host and has been tested to
function on Ubuntu with the following specific software versions:

* Ansible: 1.8.2
* Hubot: GitHub Master
* Node.js: 0.10.33
* CentOS/RHEL 6
* Ubuntu: 13.10, 13.04, 12.10, 12.04

## Role Variables

All variables are specified in `defaults/main.yml` and `vars/main.yml`.

If you add more Hubot scripts to the list defined in the **Variables**

installed by default:

which is a dependency of the Hubot `redis-brain` script.

## Configuration

At a minimum, modify the variables defined in the following files as
necessary:

* `defaults/main.yml`
* `vars/main.yml`

Then, copy `templates/hubot.env.j2` to `templates/_hubot.env.j2` and update as
necessary with the particular environment variables you need for your Hubot.

Copy `hosts.example` to `hosts` and edit it to update the values for your
Hubot host. Be sure to change the following values:

* `0.0.0.0`
* `ubuntu`
* `~/.ssh/hubot_id`

Finally, update the `site.yml` playbook if you plan to use it and set
`hubot_identity` to the short username of your bot.

## Example Playbook

After configuration a basic Hubot installation and activation is possible
using the included `site.yml` playbook:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml
```

You can also simply pass variables in using the `--extra-vars` option
to the `ansible-playbook` command:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml --extra-vars "hubot_admin=penelope hubot_adapter=slack hubot_identity=penelope hubot_owner='Penelope <penelope@example.com>' hubot_description='A stunning mermaid bot'"
```
